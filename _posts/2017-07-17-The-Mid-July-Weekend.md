## Weekend from July 14 to 17 ##

### Wisdom Teeth ###
I went to the hospital for a dentist appointment on Friday. Thankfully the last 2 of my 4 wisdom teeth were pulled off. I got 1 stitch though. The following weekend was a emotionless black hole. I felt like a brainless zombie.

### Discipline ###
I have lots disadvantages. And I decide to work on the chaotic aspects of my life: no lingering on the bed in the morning; a fixed yet also flexible learning pattern.

### Reading ###
Bought a ebook on Amazon : 红顶商人胡雪岩。 These days the richest man in China seems to struggle with government's foreign money control.  A friend mentions Hu Xueyan and I think it could be a profound topic to follow up.

### Me ###
A part of me is changing day by day, and another part seems to be in my DNA.
