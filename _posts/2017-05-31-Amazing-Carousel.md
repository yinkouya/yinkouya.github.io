### I have always wanted a carousel 
I have always wanted a carousel even since I visited [cinephilia 迷影]{http://cinephilia.net}  !

I added a carousel on my page immediately, but it's unbelievably ugly. The pictures are off size, and I don't know why it is aligning left.

Pressing enter twice, I will get two paragraphs. Leaving two blank spaces at the line end, I can get a line break.

This blog is so ugly right now, I'm going to fix it up a little bit later today.  :kissing::kissing::kissing:

今天真是玩了一天的carousel， 最后一page build failure 告终，我的眼睛也乏的不行了。
待解决：
- carousel居中， post靠两边
- footer跟post叠在一起了
- carousel的controller点击无法next!大事件！
- carousel跟p的top margin到底是怎么回事儿？
- post page好丑
