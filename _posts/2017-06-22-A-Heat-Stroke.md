# I had a heat stroke today, almost fainted in the elevator

## Thing are fine before I enter the elevator
It took me 30 minutes from my house to workplace, by foot. I entered the elevator with a couple of others, soon I sensed something wrong: my head was spinning while the elevator went up.

It first stopped at floor 2, and then it moved up to floor 4, but somehow I was determined to get out before it reached 5.

My head was covered in mud, blocking everything. I had an unfortunate experience of heat stroke 2 years ago, and I found this sensation familiar.

I went out of the elevator, leaning against the wall. I felt slightly better but not well still. I mad a wrong decision to walk up to the fifth floor, and in this process, **I couldn't hear my footsteps**. This is familiar-- I lost my hearing in that period last time.

It went to hell when I climbed up 1 floor. I had to lean my body agaist the wall and even so I couldn't support myself. I had to bend over. A female walked out, glancing at me.

I felt bad, I didn't know when I was gonna faint, since I faited last time. I needed to go to my work station! And I did. I sat down and lean on my desk.

## I knew I was safe, but physically I was not better at all
Weak, I mumbled to my college, asking her to fetch me a glass of water. She brought me luckwarm water, how nice. My body was washed in sweat.

They got me cooling oil, I applied it on my temples. The dizziness gradually went away, my head was finally not wrapped in a bubble of mud.

I was still in shock. After permission, I went into a meeting room to rest, casted out later by someone who booked the room. I went into another. I was suffering from belly ache. Sleepy and tired.

**It's all of a sudden, my body suffered and my mind is shock -- It could have been worse.**

## This is the end of my heat stroke story
I will carry a bottle of cooling water with me all the time. And drink a lot.
