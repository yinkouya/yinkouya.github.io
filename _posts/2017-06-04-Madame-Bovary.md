### I watched 3 movies titled Madame Bovary, nonstop

I was totally blown away. Now I understand why the film 我不是潘金莲 is translated to I'not Madame Bovary. Still these two females are quite different.

Madame Bovary wants so many nice things, but it's not in her position to ask for more.

Books and music bore her. She wants beautiful yet expensive dresses, she longs for dances and parties in a loyal member's house. She wants to feel love.
Her loving yet untalented husband can't satisfy her, not financially or emotionally. She cheats on him, more than once.
 
在bili上看的时候,有一条弹幕"野花不适合家养", 精辟.

以及想到女性瘾者.
