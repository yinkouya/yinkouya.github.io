      <h4>About this site</h4>
      <p>This blog is powered by Jekyll.
      <br />I experiment web features here, mainly from bootstrap 4 and other websites with great layout and design.
      <br />No surprise if my blog looks too much and incoherent.
      <br />My posts are notes for coding, and other stuff that I feel necessary writing down.

      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>I'm a wannabe front-end developer.
      <br />This blog is basically my cloud notes.
      <br />I live in Shenzhen, China. I speak Chinese, English, and a little French.
