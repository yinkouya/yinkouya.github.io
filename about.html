      <h3>Work in progress</h3>
      <p>I'm a wanna-be web designer, I write stuff here to record my life.</p>
      <p>I spend over 5 minute when brushing teeth -- My 4 wisdom teeth (2 pulled out) are no fun.</p>
      <p>Philosophy is fascinating, I have so many questions about life.</p>
      <p>At times I struggle with my anxieties and insecurites.</p>
      <p><i>Only by working continuously.</i></p>
