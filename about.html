      <h4>About this site</h4>
      <p>This blog is powered by Jekyll.
      <br />I experiment web features here, mainly from bootstrap 4.
      <br />Inspired by websites with great layout and design, I try to make it happen here. No surprise if my blog looks too much and incoherent.
      <br />My posts are notes for coding, and other stuff that I feel necessary writing down.

      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>I'm a wannabe front-end developer. Looking forward to find a relevant job soon.
      <br />This blog is basically my cloud notes. Writing has such a soothing effect on me, though it doesn't necessary mean I'm good at it.
      <br />I'm decent with HTML and CSS, need to work it up with Javascript. Also familiar with Python and Linux.
      <br />I live in Shenzhen, China. I speak Chinese, English, and a little French.
      <br />Let me know you exist, drop a note at yinkouya@163.com.</p>
